# Router 1x3 Verilog Implementation ðŸš€

Routing involves transferring data packets from a source to a destination, allowing messages to traverse from one computer to another until they reach their final target. A router is a critical networking device that directs these data packets between different computer networks. Unlike a network switch, which connects lines within a single network, a router connects two or more data lines from separate networks.

This project focuses on the detailed study and implementation of a router device using Verilog. It covers the design and integration of key sub-modules, including the Register, FIFO, FSM, and Synchronizer. Each sub-module is synthesized, simulated, and then integrated into the top-level architecture of the router. The end result is a fully functional router model capable of handling data routing between multiple networks.
